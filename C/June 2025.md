## Chapter 1
Chapter 1 introduces the C language, created in the 1970s at Bell Labs, highlighting its evolution through standards like C89 and C99. It emphasizes C’s strengths: efficiency, portability, and suitability for system-level programming. The chapter presents the structure of a basic C program, including the use of preprocessor directives like `#include`. It explains that every program must have a `main` function and may also use standard library functions. The compilation process—from editing to execution—is outlined step by step. Basic elements such as comments, variables, assignment, and simple I/O using `printf` and `scanf` are introduced. The chapter aims to gently ease the reader into C programming before diving into more formal and detailed aspects in later chapters.


## Chapter 2
Chapter 2 covers the fundamentals of writing simple C programs: it begins with a program that prints a message and explains the compilation and linking steps. Next, it introduces the general form of a C program—preprocessor directives, functions (especially `main`), and statements—and shows how to print strings. It then discusses comments for documenting code. The chapter explores variables and assignment, including declaring `int` and `float` types, initialization, and using variables in expressions. Input is introduced via `scanf`, with an example revisited to read and process user input. The use of named constants via `#define` is shown through a temperature conversion program. Finally, it explains identifiers (names and keywords) and program layout, covering formatting and whitespace rules.


## Chapter 3
Chapter 3 focuses on formatted input and output in C, primarily using the `printf` and `scanf` functions. It explains how `printf` can format output using *conversion specifiers* such as `%d` (integers), `%f` (floating-point numbers), `%e` (scientific notation), `%g` (shortest of `%f`/`%e`), `%c` (characters), and `%s` (strings). The chapter introduces **formatting tools** like `\n` (newline), `\t` (tab), `\\` (backslash), and `%%` (percent sign), which help organize output visually. It also explains how to control output alignment and spacing with *field width and precision modifiers*, e.g. `%5d` (minimum width), `%-5d` (left-aligned), and `%.2f` (two decimal places). For input, `scanf` is introduced with similar format specifiers, and the chapter discusses how whitespace and buffer behavior affect input reliability. Practical examples illustrate how to gather and display user data clearly. Lastly, the chapter gives an overview of tokens in C (keywords, constants, identifiers, etc.), laying the groundwork for understanding how formatted I/O fits into full C programs.ù
