## Introduction

As I wanted to start to learn Ethical Hacking, I didn't know where to begin, I searched online and I found that the best way to master some good skills in this field is, first of all, to build the foundamentals.
In fact I had to start building my skill palace from the very foundations of it, so I had to dig the ground and ensure that it won't collapse when my building will be really high.
Said so, I started from networking since it's the basic to achieve higher results, in this sort of blog I'm going to deep dive in my path to learn as much as I can in the networking field.

Hope you find it usefull
