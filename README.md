# Ethical Hacking Journey

This repository documents my journey into **ethical hacking**. It's a collection of projects, notes, and resources from my learning process. My goal is to share what I learn, solidify my knowledge, and perhaps inspire others.

## Project Structure

I will upload what I learned and how I learned it in each field of the Ethical Hacking world, starting from networking and OS basis to web exploit and more advanced things. <br>
Doing this I want to help people that were in my same conditions, where I was learning frammented things from different sources and I had some difficulties to put everything together.<br>
Hope this helps
