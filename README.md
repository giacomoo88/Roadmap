# 📚 Study Roadmap

This repository contains monthly notes based on chapters read from books or resources. Each folder represents a specific topic, and inside each, you’ll find text files organized by month.

## 🗂️ Structure

* **Folders**: One per topic (e.g., `C/`, `Python/`, etc.)
* **Files**: Inside each folder:

  * `YYYY-MM-notes.txt`: key concepts and notes for that month (e.g., `2025-04-notes.txt`)

## 📆 Purpose

* Keep track of what you’ve learned month by month.
* Quickly revisit essential concepts when needed.
* Maintain an organized, modular study journal.

## 📌 How to Use

1. **Create a folder** for every new topic you start studying.
2. **Each month**, add a new `YYYY-MM-notes.txt` file:

   * Bullet points summarizing what you’ve learned.
   * Practical examples.
   * Any difficulties or follow-up points.

## 🎯 Note Guidelines

* Use **headings and subheadings** to structure content.
* Prefer **bullet points** for clarity and ease of reading.
* Include **short code snippets** where relevant.
* Add **external links or references** for further study.
